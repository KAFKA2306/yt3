        High dividend yields can be a 'trap' (the 'rotten apple' analogy) if the
        company is paying out capital rather than profits, leading to stock
        price crashes that exceed the dividend gains.
      - >-
        True asset formation is achieved by maximizing the power of compound
        interest over a long horizon (10+ years) rather than chasing short-term
