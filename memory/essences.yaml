        High dividend yields can be a 'trap' (the 'rotten apple' analogy) if the
        company is paying out capital rather than profits, leading to stock
        price crashes that exceed the dividend gains.

        Post-2008 regulations have restricted banks from high-risk lending,

    key_insights:
      - >-
        The 'Great Rotation' is underway, shifting global capital from
        overvalued US stocks to historically undervalued Chinese stocks.
      - >-
        China's late September 2024 stimulus is considered a 'bazooka' because
        the central bank is directly providing funds to support stock prices, a
        move compared to Mario Draghi's 'Whatever it takes' moment.
      - >-
        The 'All Country' (Orkan) investment strategy has a blind spot: it is
        heavily weighted toward the US (60%+) and has minimal exposure to China
        (a few percent), making it vulnerable if the US market plateaus while
        emerging markets surge.
      - >-
        Professional sentiment has shifted: Ray Dalio views this as a historical
        turning point, and Goldman Sachs has upgraded Chinese stocks to
        'Overweight'.
    data_points:
      - 'China''s stimulus package: 800 billion yuan (approx. 16 trillion yen).'
      - >-
        CSI 300 Index performance: ~16% increase in a single week (highest since
        2008).
      - 'US stock weighting in ''All Country'' (Orkan) funds: Over 60%.'
      - >-
        China stock weighting in 'All Country' (Orkan) funds: Only a few
        percent.

      - >-
        Contrarian Entry: Maximum 'despair' in a market often represents the
        best entry point for professional investors.
      - >-
        Mean Reversion/Rotation: No single market dominance lasts forever;
        capital eventually flows from overvalued assets to undervalued ones.
      - >-
        Concentration Risk: Relying on a single country's dominance
        (US-centricity) creates a 'blind spot' in a diversified portfolio during
        global shifts.
    connections:
      - >-
        The synergy between the FRB's interest rate cuts and China's massive
        stimulus is acting as a dual catalyst for the 'Great Rotation'.
      - >-
        The gap between retail investor 'common sense' (US stocks are safest)
        and professional money flow (moving to emerging markets) creates a
        potential wealth gap.
      - >-
        The current Chinese market situation is linked to the 2012 European debt
        crisis through the 'Whatever it takes' policy framework, signaling a
        strong institutional will to end deflation.

    key_insights:
      - >-
        Structural inflation is inevitable regardless of the US election
        outcome, ending the era of low-interest-rate-driven growth.
      - >-
        The shift from globalization ('cheap goods') to domestic production and
        supply chain decoupling is a permanent cost-driver.
      - >-
        A 'higher-for-longer' interest rate environment (4-5%) will force a
        fundamental correction in stock market valuations.
      - >-
        Japanese investors face a 'double punch' risk: high US rates sustain yen
        depreciation, while simultaneously cooling the US economy and depressing
        stock prices.
    data_points:
      - 'Trump''s proposed tariffs: 10-20% on all imports, 60% on Chinese goods.'
      - >-
        Goldman Sachs estimate: Trump's tariff plan could push US inflation up
        by 1.1%.
      - >-
        Historical reference: 1970s inflation led to policy rates peaking near
        20%.
      - 'Projected ''new normal'' interest rates: 4-5% range.'
    universal_principles:
      - >-
        The 'Second Wave' of inflation: Initial inflation spikes often subside
        only to reignite due to policy shifts or geopolitical risks.
      - >-
        Valuation Sensitivity: Stock prices are fundamentally tied to interest
        rates; when the 'risk-free rate' floor rises, price-to-earnings
        multiples must contract.
      - >-
        The end of the 'Peace Dividend': Globalization acted as a deflationary
        force; its reversal is inherently inflationary.
    connections:
      - >-
        Political policy (Tariffs/Decoupling) → Supply chain fragmentation →
        Structural cost increases → Persistent inflation.
      - >-
        Persistent inflation → Higher-for-longer interest rates → Downward
        pressure on high-valuation indices (S&P 500/Nasdaq).
      - >-
        US High Interest Rates + Economic Slowdown → Real purchasing power loss
        for Japanese NISA investors despite nominal yen gains.
