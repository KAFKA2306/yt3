        High dividend yields can be a 'trap' (the 'rotten apple' analogy) if the
        company is paying out capital rather than profits, leading to stock
        price crashes that exceed the dividend gains.

        Post-2008 regulations have restricted banks from high-risk lending,

        The shift in 'money flow' means that traditional bank deposits are no
        longer the primary engine of corporate growth, necessitating a move
        toward alternative assets in personal portfolios.

        The democratization of high-yield products (opening to individual
        investors) coincides with peak systemic risk, echoing patterns seen
        before previous financial crises.

        Copper is the physical 'bottleneck' of the AI revolution, acting as the
        essential 'blood vessels' (wiring and cooling) for data centers.
      - >-
        The industry is shifting from organic growth to aggressive M&A because
        the lead time to start a new copper mine is approximately 15 years,
        which is too slow to meet 2030 AI demands.
      - >-
        Copper has transitioned from a simple commodity to a 'strategic
        material' essential for national survival due to simultaneous global
        electrification and AI expansion.
      - >-
        Supply is being squeezed by a 'perfect storm': explosive demand from AI
        and green tech, coupled with geopolitical instability and environmental
        protests (e.g., Panama mine closure).

        7.5 trillion yen: The value of BHP's failed acquisition bid for Anglo
        American to secure copper assets.
      - >-
        15 years: The average duration from the discovery of a copper deposit to
        the start of actual production.
      - >-
        2 million tons: The projected additional copper demand specifically for
        AI data centers by 2030.
      - >-
        1%: The total global supply of copper lost due to the sudden closure of
        a major mine in Panama.

        Physical Constraints on Digital Growth: No matter how advanced software
        or logic chips become, they are ultimately limited by the physical
        infrastructure (power and heat management) that supports them.
      - >-
        Time-to-Market vs. Capital: In industries with extreme lead times,
        capital cannot buy time; it can only buy existing assets (M&A over
        exploration).

        Resource Essentiality: The value of a resource is determined by its role
        as a non-substitutable component in a high-growth ecosystem.

        The link between NVIDIA's GPU success and the physical mining industry:
        High-performance computing requires massive electrical throughput, which
        is entirely dependent on copper.
      - >-
        The tension between Environmentalism and Technology: Environmental
        protection efforts (like those in Panama) can inadvertently throttle the
        supply of materials needed for the 'green' and 'digital' transitions.
      - >-
        The shift from Silicon-centric thinking to Infrastructure-centric
        thinking: Investors must look beyond the 'brain' (chips) to the 'nervous
        system' (copper) of the global economy.
